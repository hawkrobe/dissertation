\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Language is not some monolithic body of knowledge that we acquire at an early age and deploy mechanically for the rest of our lives. Nor is its evolution a slow, inter-generational drift. It is a means for communication -- a shared interface between minds -- and must therefore adapt over the rapid timescales required by communication. In other words, we are constantly learning language. Not just one language, but an enormous family of related languages, across every repeated interaction with every partner.
